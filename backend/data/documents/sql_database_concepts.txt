SQL Database Concepts
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
Basic SQL Commands
SELECT
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database:
sql-- Select all columns from a table
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customers;

-- Select with a WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';
INSERT
The INSERT statement is used to insert new records in a table:
sqlINSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email, country)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'USA');
UPDATE
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records:
sqlUPDATE customers
SET email = 'john.new@example.com'
WHERE customer_id = 1;
DELETE
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records:
sqlDELETE FROM customers
WHERE customer_id = 1;
Joins
SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables:
INNER JOIN
Returns records that have matching values in both tables:
sqlSELECT orders.order_id, customers.first_name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table:
sqlSELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table:
sqlSELECT customers.first_name, orders.order_id
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
Indexing
Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly. Users can't see the indexes, they're just used to speed up searches/queries:
sql-- Create an index on a table
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname
ON customers (last_name);
Proper index design is critical for database performance optimization.
